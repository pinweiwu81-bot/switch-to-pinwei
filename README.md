# 🎮 Pin-Wei's Switch Portfolio (2026 Edition)

> *"Life is a game, and I'm playing for the high score in Operations & Customer Success."*

Welcome to my **interactive gamified portfolio**! This project transforms a traditional resume into a fully functional "Nintendo Switch" interface, completely built with standard web technologies.

## 🕹️ About The Project
I wanted to showcase my technical creativity and my professional journey in a way that stands out. Instead of a scrolling PDF, you get a console experience. Instead of bullet points, you get game levels.

**Tech Stack:**
*   **HTML5 & CSS3**: Custom animations, pure CSS art, and responsive layout.
*   **Vanilla JavaScript**: Game logic, navigation systems, and interactive modals.
*   **No Frameworks**: Built from scratch to demonstrate core coding understanding.

## 👾 How to Play
You can run this portfolio locally by opening `index.html` in your browser.

**Controls:**
*   **⬅️ ➡️ Arrow Keys** or **Mouse**: Navigate the menu.
*   **Enter** or **Click**: Select a game cartridge.
*   **Esc**: Go back to the main menu.

## 📂 Game Cartridges (Resume Sections)
1.  **🏎️ Career Kart (Experience)**: A racing circuit where every "Cup" represents a major role (Quizrr, Hyper Island, Gaston Luga).
2.  **⚡ Skill Master (Skills)**: A generic monster-battle simulator where I use skills like "Excel VLOOKUP" and "HubSpot Auto" to defeat business challenges.
3.  **🌲 My Story (Bio)**: An "Otome" style visual novel exploring my journey from Taiwan to Sweden.
4.  **📬 Connect (Contact)**: The "End Credits" scene with my contact details.

## 🚀 Why I Built This
To demonstrate that **Operations Managers** can also be **Builders**. I don't just manage processes; I understand the logic and structure behind them.
